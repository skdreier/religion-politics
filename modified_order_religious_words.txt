# Search Words
#
# Current list is union of chapp_relig.csv and liwc_relig.csv lists,
# but the script will work if replaced with any list of at least two
# words. Matches will be case-insensitive. Each phrase to search must
# be contained in exactly one line.
#
# Words removed from the original list:
#     all repeated words (though the script would have filtered them out anyway)
#     angle (I think it might have been a typo of angel?)
#     agonstic (changed to "agnostic" instead, seemed like typo)
#
# Reserved phrases (also case-insensitive):
#     anything that includes ```````` or starts/ends with `
#     (DEPRECATED) anything containing *
#        * signifies "here is a string that is allowed to come after"
#        ** signifies "here is a string that is allowed to come before"
#        example:   un**ironic*ally
#        Can also allow wild card matches before or after word, or both before
#        and after (example: **ironic*)
#     anything containing # (since # is used to denote the start of a list
#        of phrases, and subsequent separations between phrases, that *aren't*
#        supposed to be captured as a match for the expression)
#        (these exceptions may NOT use * to denote multiple possible exceptions;
#         all exceptions must be spelled out exactly)
#        example:   un**ironic*ally  # unironic
