# Keyword-Counting Search Words
#
# All search words must be single words with no whitespace.
#
# Current list is union of chapp_relig.csv and liwc_relig.csv lists,
# but the script will work if replaced with any list of at least two
# words. Matches will be case-insensitive. Each phrase to search must
# be contained in exactly one line.
#
# It's worth mentioning that text will be considered a match for one
# of the provided search terms as long as the (case-insensitive) search
# term is contained within the text; in other words, matches can be made
# with the search term making up only a substring of the word/phrase it
# was matched to.
#
# To get around some of the issues that might arise from either
# double-counting matches (for example, since "amen" is a substring
# of "fundamentalist", every match for "fundamentalist" would also be
# considered a match for "amen") or flagging some words that are
# completely unrelated as matches (for example, "amenity" as a match
# for "amen"), a possible match occurring in text will only be made
# to the longest search term provided here that is a valid candidate.
# In addition, adding a string (such as one for amenity) after a # on
# the same line as a search term will keep occurrences of that string
# from being flagged as matches for the search term.
#
# Words removed from the original list:
#     all repeated words (though the script would have filtered them out anyway)
#     angle (I think it might have been a typo of angel?)
#     agonstic (changed to "agnostic" instead, seemed like typo)
#
# Reserved phrases (also case-insensitive):
#     anything that includes `````````````` or starts/ends with `
#     anything containing # (since # is used to denote the start of a list
#        of phrases, and subsequent separations between phrases, that *aren't*
#        supposed to be captured as a match for the expression)
